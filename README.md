Cross platform 128bit AES encryption / decryption.
========
This project contains the implementation of 128 bit AES encryption which works on all the platforms (C#, iOS(Swift), Java Android, PHP and Java backend). 

<b>Platforms Supported:</b>

1. iOS Swift4)

2. Java Android

3. Dot Net (C#) [Also works with .Net Core]

4. Java Backend

5. PHP

<b>Features:</b>

Cross platform support. Encryption-Decryption works across C#, Swift, Java and PHP. 


<b>How to encrypt/decrypt a string:</b>

See code samples for more details. You'll have to perform following steps:

1. Use a common secret key across all platform.
2. Call the CryptoHelper.encrypt(String) for encryption.
3. Call the CryptoHelper.decrypt(String) for decryption.
